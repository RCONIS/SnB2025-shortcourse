# Workaround for the following Quarto issue (do not remove):
# Quarto will not render embedded R code unless at least one R code chunk exists
```

## Today

What are we going to do today?

Give you a preview of the course *"Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages"* at the [SnB 2025 conference](https://snb2025.sciencesconf.org/) in Paris, France!

But no worries if you can't make it to the conference, we will share all materials online ...

Plus you will learn some awesome things right here, today!

## What do we mean by GSWEP4R\*?

::: aside
\* Good Software Engineering Practice for R
:::

-   Applying concept of "Good XYZ Practice" to SWE with R
-   Improve **quality** and **longevity** of R code/packages  
-   Not a universal standard; we share our perspectives
-   Collection of best practices
-   Do not reinvent the wheel: learn from the community

## Why care about GSWEP4R?

-   R is one of the most successfull statistical programming languages
-   R is a powerful yet complex *ecosystem*
    -   Core component: R packages
    -   Mature analysts: users & contributors
    -   Deep understanding crucial, even to just assess quality
-   Analyses increasingly require complex scripts/programs
-   The concepts are applicable to other languages, too (Python, Julia, etc.)

## What you will learn in the short course

-   Understand the basic structure of an R package
-   Create your own R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")`
-   Learn about & apply professional `r fontawesome::fa("cube")` development workflow
-   Learn & apply fundamentals of quality control for R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")`
-   Learn how to make an R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")` available to others


<!-- Daniel -->

## Start small - from script to package

1.  Encapsulate behavior (functions)
2.  Avoid global state/variables
3.  Adopt consistent coding style
4.  Document well
5.  Add test cases
6.  Refactor and optimize code
7.  Version your code
8.  Share as an R package

<!-- Jack -->

## Structure of an R package

-  The source of an R package is a directory with a specific structure:
   - `DESCRIPTION` file with metadata
   - `NAMESPACE` file to define API 
   - `R/` directory with R scripts - the "meat" of the package!
   - `man/` directory with documentation
   - `tests/` directory with test scripts (optional but important!)
   - other optional directories (`data/`, `vignettes/`, `inst/`, etc.)
-  The package can be built into a single file (tarball) for CRAN submission, email etc.

## How to start creating an R package?

-  Use the `usethis` package to create a new package
   -  `usethis::create_package("path/to/package")`
-  Use RStudio to create a new package project
   -  File > New Project > New Directory > R Package
-  Creates the required directory structure and files for you!

<!-- Daniel -->

## Which steps should I make?

-  Recommend to start with a "design doc"
   - What is the purpose of the package? (objectives)
   - What is the user interface? (conceptual design)
   - What are the main functions? (prototype code)
-  Align with your team and stakeholders
-  Then start with the actual package implementation
   - Build up function by function
   - Always include documentation and tests for each function

## How can I ensure a high quality of my R package?

- Use a consistent coding style
   - e.g. `snake_case` *or* `camelCase` for function names
- Use a consistent format
   -  Use [`air`](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to automatically format
- Use `lintr` package to check for common issues
- Test all of your functions, typically with the `testthat` package
- Include user facing long form documentation (vignettes) to explain how to use the package   
- Follow the [openstatsguide](https://www.openstatsware.org/guide.html) checklist

<!-- Jack -->

## How to publish my R package?

- Start with a GitHub repository
- Add a `pkgdown` website to showcase the package
- Use `devtools::check()` to check the package for common issues
- Use `rhub::check()` to check the package on different platforms
- Once ready, submit to CRAN (make sure to read the [CRAN policies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html))
- In addition or alternatively, create your [R Universe](https://docs.r-universe.dev/publish/set-up.html) to host the package

## Before and after the course

What difference will the course make?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Before

- Unstructured scripts
- Hard to reproduce results
- Difficult to share or reuse code
- No automated tests
- Inconsistent style and documentation
- Challenging to maintain or extend
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### After

- Organized R packages
- Reproducible workflows
- Easy to share and collaborate
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Consistent style and clear documentation
- Easier maintenance and future development

## The conference 

-  10th Statistics \& Biopharmacy Conference ([SnB 2025](https://snb2025.sciencesconf.org/))
-  8 to 10 October 2025, Paris, France
   -  Venue is "Les salons de l'Aveyron"
-  Invited speakers give keynote presentations, see the [list](https://snb2025.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/9)
-  Contributed talks and posters, see the [program](https://snb2025.sciencesconf.org/program?lang=en)
-  Poster and wine session
-  Conference dinner  

<!-- October is the best month in Paris for spotting gorgeous foliage throughout the city and feels quintessentially Parisian with all of the locals showing out in their best fall fashion. The evenings are cooler, so pack a sweater and coat and expect substantially less crowds than other times of year. -->

## How to register for the short course?

-  Register for the conference and/or this short course [here](https://snb2025.sciencesconf.org/registration)
