## Today

What are we going to do today?

Give you a preview of the course *"Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages"* at the [SnB 2025 conference](https://snb2025.sciencesconf.org/) in Paris, France!

But no worries if you can't make it to the conference, we will share all materials online ...

Plus you will learn some awesome things right here, today!

## Where are we from? `openstatsware`

## What you will learn in the short course

-   Understand the basic structure of an R package
-   Create your own R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")`
-   Learn about & apply professional `r fontawesome::fa("cube")` development workflow
-   Learn & apply fundamentals of quality control for R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")`
-   Learn how to make an R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")` available to others

## What do we mean by GSWEP4R\*?

::: aside
\* Good Software Engineering Practice for R
:::

-   Applying concept of "Good XYZ Practice" to SWE with R
-   Improve **quality** and **longevity** of R code/packages  
-   Not a universal standard; we share our perspectives
-   Collection of best practices
-   Do not reinvent the wheel: learn from the community

## Why care about GSWEP4R?

-   R is one of the most successfull statistical programming languages
-   R is a powerful yet complex *ecosystem*
    -   Core component: R packages
    -   Mature analysts: users & contributors
    -   Deep understanding crucial, even to just assess quality
-   Analyses increasingly require complex scripts/programs
-   The concepts are applicable to other languages, too (Python, Julia, etc.)

## Start small - from script to package

1.  Encapsulate behavior (functions)
2.  Avoid global state/variables
3.  Adopt consistent coding style
4.  Document well
5.  Add test cases
6.  Refactor and optimize code
7.  Version your code
8.  Share as 'bundle'

## Before and after the course

What difference will the course make?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Before

- Unstructured scripts
- Hard to reproduce results
- Difficult to share or reuse code
- No automated tests
- Inconsistent style and documentation
- Challenging to maintain or extend
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### After

- Organized R packages
- Reproducible workflows
- Easy to share and collaborate
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Consistent style and clear documentation
- Easier maintenance and future development
